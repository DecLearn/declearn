# declearn v2.0.2

This sub-minor version back-ports changes introduced in declearn v2.1.0.

Released: 02/03/2023

Changes:

* Make network communication dependencies truly optional.
    - Previously, `websockets` and `grpcio` could already be done without,
      however, `pip install declearn` would always install them.
    - The patch now properly turns them into extra dependencies, that are
      only installed when explicitly required by the end-user.
* Complete a broken docstring (`declearn.metrics.BinaryRocAUC`).
* Update git branching strategy (no impact on the package's use).

Note: the PyPI upload is labeled as "v2.0.2.2" due to the initial upload missing a bump to the in-code version number.
