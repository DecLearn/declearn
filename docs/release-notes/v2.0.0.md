# declearn v2.0.0

Released: 06/02/2023

This is the first stable and public release of declearn.

As of this release, the package has been tested under python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 (with the latter lacking TensorFlow support for now).
The coverage statistic is 72%. This value is undermined by the fact that some tests are run via multiprocessing. It was evaluated by running the same tests as programmed in our tox config, using the pytest-cov plug-in.
