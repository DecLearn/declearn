# declearn v2.3.2

Released: 05/10/2023

This is a subminor release that patches extra dependency specifiers for Torch.

## Revise Torch extra dependency specifiers and version support

The rules for the "torch", "torch1" and "torch2" extra dependency specifiers
were updated in order to be simpler and support the newest Torch 2.1 version.
As a trade off, support for older Torch versions 1.10 to 1.12 was dropped, due
to functorch being shipped together with versions >=1.13, enabling to remove
the burden of having to clumsily specify for it (in spite of it no longer being
used starting with version 2.0).

The opacus dependency is back to being specified merely by the "dp" extra
specifier, which may be updated (either independently from or together with)
"torch" in the future - and may also be specified freely by declearn-depending
packages, starting with Fed-BioMed.
