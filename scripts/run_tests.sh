Bash script to launch test pipelines for declearn.

This script comprises the following (types of) functions:

- Backend utilities to verbosely run (sets of) commands and report
  on their success/failure status:
    - run_command "<command> [arguments]*"
        Verbosely run a single string-defined command.
    - run_commands "context" ["<commmand> [arguments]+"]+
        Verbosely run a sequence of string-defined commands,
        and report on the number of failed ones afterwards.

- Functions that run (sets of) commands defining a category of tests:
    - lint_declearn_code
        Run the pylint, mypy and black commands on the source code.
    - lint_declearn_tests
        Run the pylint, mypy and black commands on the tests code.
    - run_declearn_tests [pytest_args]*
        Run unit and integrations tests, managing coverage computation
        and reporting, using pytest, flags to which may be provided.

- Functions that make up bits of the 'run_declearn_tests' one:
    - run_unit_tests [pytest_args]*
    - run_integration_tests [pytest_args]*
    - run_torch13_tests [pytest_args]*

- The 'main' entry point, that enables calling any of the category of tests.

Instructions for developers/maintainers:
- For linters, you may add or edit the commands that are run, which are
  declared as an array of strings within the code of the 'lint_' functions.
- For tests, you may:
    - edit commands as part of any of the current backend functions
    - add (or remove) a backend function that runs one or multiple commands,
      and edit accordingly the array of commands under 'run_declearn_tests'
- If you want to add a new group of tests, write up a function for it, and
  edit 'main' to add an input argument case for triggering it.
