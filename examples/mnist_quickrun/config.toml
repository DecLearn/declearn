# This is a minimal TOML file for the MNIST example
# It contains the bare minimum to make the experiment run.
# See quickstart for more details.

# The TOML is parsed by python as dictionnary with each `[header]`
# as a key. Note the "=" sign and the absence of quotes around keys.
# For more details, see the full doc : https://toml.io/en/
