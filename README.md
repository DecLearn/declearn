## Introduction

`declearn` is a python package providing with a framework to perform federated
learning, i.e. to train machine learning models by distributing computations
across a set of data owners that, consequently, only have to share aggregated
information (rather than individual data samples) with an orchestrating server
(and, by extension, with each other).

The aim of `declearn` is to provide both real-world end-users and algorithm
researchers with a modular and extensible framework that:

- builds on **abstractions** general enough to write backbone algorithmic code
  agnostic to the actual computation framework, statistical model details
  or network communications setup
- designs **modular and combinable** objects, so that algorithmic features, and
  more generally any specific implementation of a component (the model, network
  protocol, client or server optimizer...) may easily be plugged into the main
  federated learning process - enabling users to experiment with configurations
  that intersect unitary features
- provides with functioning tools that may be used **out-of-the-box** to set up
  federated learning tasks using some popular computation frameworks (scikit-
  learn, tensorflow, pytorch...) and federated learning algorithms (FedAvg,
  Scaffold, FedYogi...)
- provides with tools that enable **extending** the support of existing tools
  and APIs to custom functions and classes without having to hack into the
  source code, merely adding new features (tensor libraries, model classes,
  optimization plug-ins, orchestration algorithms, communication protocols...)
  to the party

At the moment, `declearn` has been focused on so-called "centralized" federated
learning that implies a central server orchestrating computations, but it might
become more oriented towards decentralized processes in the future, that remove
the use of a central agent.

## Setup

### Requirements

- python >= 3.8
- pip

Third-party requirements are specified (and automatically installed) as part
of the installation process, and may be consulted from the `pyproject.toml`
file.

### Optional requirements

Some third-party requirements are optional, and may not be installed. These
are also specified as part of the `pyproject.toml` file, and may be divided
into two categories:<br/>
(a) dependencies of optional, applied declearn components (such as the PyTorch
and Tensorflow tensor libraries, or the gRPC and websockets network
communication backends) that are not imported with declearn by default<br/>
(b) dependencies for running tests on the package (mainly pytest and some of
its plug-ins)

The second category is more developer-oriented, while the first may or may not
be relevant depending on the use case to which you wish to apply `declearn`.

In the `pyproject.toml` file, the `[project.optional-dependencies]` tables
`all` and `test` respectively list the first and (first + second) categories,
while additional tables redundantly list dependencies unit by unit.

### Using a virtual environment (optional)

It is generally advised to use a virtual environment, to avoid any dependency
conflict between declearn and packages you might use in separate projects. To
do so, you may for example use python's built-in
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), or the third-party tool
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

Venv instructions (example):

```bash
python -m venv ~/.venvs/declearn
source ~/.venvs/declearn/bin/activate
```

Conda instructions (example):

```bash
conda create -n declearn python=3.8 pip
conda activate declearn
```

_Note: at the moment, conda installation is not recommended, because the
package's installation is made slightly harder due to some dependencies being
installable via conda while other are only available via pip/pypi, which caninstall
lead to dependency-tracking trouble._

### Installation

#### Install from PyPI

Stable releases of the package are uploaded to
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/declearn/), enabling one to install with:

```bash
pip install declearn  # optionally with version constraints and/or extras
```

#### Install from source

Alternatively, to install from source, one may clone the git repository (or
download the source code from a release) and run `pip install .` from its
root folder.

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.inria.fr:magnet/declearn/declearn.git
cd declearn
pip install .  # or pip install -e .
```

#### Install extra dependencies

To also install optional requirements, add the name of the extras between
brackets to the `pip install` command, _e.g._ running one of the following:

```bash
# Examples of cherry-picked installation instructions.
pip install declearn[grpc]   # install dependencies to use gRPC communications
pip install declearn[torch]  # install `declearn.model.torch` dependencies
pip install declearn[tensorflow,torch]  # install both tensorflow and torch

# Instructions to install bundles of optional components.
pip install declearn[all]    # install all extra dependencies, save for testing
pip install declearn[tests]  # install all extra dependencies plus testing ones
```

#### Notes

- If you are not using a virtual environment, select carefully the `pip` binary
  being called (e.g. use `python -m pip`), and/or add a `--user` flag to the
  pip command.
- Developers may have better installing the package in editable mode, using
  `pip install -e .` from the repository's root folder.
- If you are installing the package within a conda environment, it may be
  better to run `pip install --no-deps declearn` so as to only install the
  package, and then to manually install the dependencies listed in the
  `pyproject.toml` file, using `conda install` rather than `pip install`
  whenever it is possible.

## Quickstart

### Setting

Here is a quickstart example on how to set up a federated learning process
to learn a LASSO logistic regression model (using a scikit-learn backend)
using pre-processed data, formatted as csv files with a "label" column,
where each client has two files: one for training, the other for validation.

Here, the code uses:

- standard FedAvg strategy (SGD for local steps, averaging of updates weighted
  by clients' training dataset size, no modifications of server-side updates)
- 10 rounds of training, with 5 local epochs performed at each round and
  128-samples batch size
- at least 1 and at most 3 clients, awaited for 180 seconds by the server
- network communications using gRPC, on host "example.com" and port 8888

Note that this example code may easily be adjusted to suit use cases, using
other types of models, alternative federated learning algorithms and/or
modifying the communication, training and validation hyper-parameters.
Please refer to the [Hands-on usage](#hands-on-usage) section for a more
detailed and general description of how to set up a federated learning
task and process with declearn.

### Server-side script

```python
import declearn

model = declearn.model.sklearn.SklearnSGDModel.from_parameters(
    kind="classifier", loss="log_loss", penalty="l1"
)
netwk = declearn.communication.NetworkServerConfig(
    protocol="grpc", host="example.com", port=8888,
    certificate="path/to/certificate.pem",
    private_key="path/to/private_key.pem"
)
optim = declearn.main.config.FLOptimConfig.from_params(
    aggregator="averaging",
    client_opt=0.001,
)
server = declearn.main.FederatedServer(
    model, netwk, optim, checkpoint="outputs"
)
config = declearn.main.config.FLRunConfig.from_params(
    rounds=10,
    register={"min_clients": 1, "max_clients": 3, "timeout": 180},
    training={"n_epoch": 5, "batch_size": 128, "drop_remainder": False},
)
server.run(config)
```

### Client-side script

```python
import declearn

netwk = declearn.communication.NetworkClientConfig(
    protocol="grpc",
    server_uri="example.com:8888",
    name="client_name",
    certificate="path/to/client_cert.pem"
)
train = declearn.dataset.InMemoryDataset(
    "path/to/train.csv", target="label",
    expose_classes=True  # enable sharing of unique target values
)
valid = declearn.dataset.InMemoryDataset("path/to/valid.csv", target="label")
client = declearn.main.FederatedClient(netwk, train, valid, checkpoint="outputs")
client.run()
```

### Support for GPU acceleration

TL;DR: GPU acceleration is natively available in `declearn` for model
frameworks that support it, with one line of code and without changing
your original model.

Details:

Most machine learning frameworks, including Tensorflow and Torch, enable
accelerating computations by using computational devices other than CPU.
`declearn` interfaces supported frameworks to be able to set a device policy
in a single line of code, accross frameworks.

`declearn` internalizes the framework-specific code adaptations to place the
data, model weights and computations on such a device. `declearn` provides
with a simple API to define a global device policy. This enables using a
single GPU to accelerate computations, or forcing the use of a CPU.

By default, the policy is set to use the first available GPU, and otherwise
use the CPU, with a warning that can safely be ignored.

Setting the device policy to be used can be done in local scripts, either as a
client or as a server. Device policy is local and is not synchronized between
federated learninng participants.

Here are some examples of the one-liner used:
```python
declearn.utils.set_device_policy(gpu=False)  # disable GPU use
declearn.utils.set_device_policy(gpu=True)  # use any available GPU
declearn.utils.set_device_policy(gpu=True, idx=2)  # specifically use GPU n°2
```

### Note on dependency sharing

One important issue however that is not handled by declearn itself is that
of ensuring that clients have loaded all dependencies that may be required
to unpack the Model and Optimizer instances transmitted at initialization.
At the moment, it is therefore left to users to agree on the dependencies
that need to be imported as part of the client-side launching script.

For example, if the trained model is an artificial neural network that uses
PyTorch as implementation backend, clients will need to add the
`import declearn.model.torch` statement in their code (and, obviously, to
have `torch` installed). Similarly, if a custom declearn `OptiModule` was
written to modify the way updates are computed locally by clients, it will
need to be shared with clients - either as a package to be imported (like
torch previously), or as a bit of source code to add on top of the script.

## Usage of the Python API

### Overview of the Federated Learning process

This overview describes the way the `declearn.main.FederatedServer`
and `declearn.main.FederatedClient` pair of classes implement the
federated learning process. It is however possible to subclass
these and/or implement alternative orchestrating classes to define
alternative overall algorithmic processes - notably by overriding
or extending methods that define the sub-components of the process
exposed here.

#### Overall process orchestrated by the server

- Initially:
  - have the clients connect and register for training
  - prepare model and optimizer objects on both sides
- Iteratively:
  - perform a training round
  - perform an evaluation round
  - decide whether to continue, based on the number of
    rounds taken or on the evolution of the global loss
- Finally:
  - restore the model weights that yielded the lowest global loss
  - notify clients that training is over, so they can disconnect
    and run their final routine (e.g. save the "best" model)
  - optionally checkpoint the "best" model
  - close the network server and end the process

#### Detail of the process phases

- **Registration process**:
  - Server:
    - open up registration (stop rejecting all received messages)
    - handle and respond to client-emitted registration requests
    - await criteria to have been met (exact or min/max number of clients
      registered, optionally under a given timeout delay)
    - close registration (reject future requests)
  - Client:
    - gather metadata about the local training dataset
      (_e.g._ dimensions and unique labels)
    - connect to the server and send a request to join training,
      including the former information
    - await the server's response (retry after a timeout if the request
      came in too soon, i.e. registration is not opened yet)
  - messaging : (JoinRequest <-> JoinReply)

- **Post-registration initialization**
  - Server:
    - validate and aggregate clients-transmitted metadata
    - finalize the model's initialization using those metadata
    - send the model, local optimizer and evaluation metrics specs to clients
  - Client:
    - instantiate the model, optimizer and metrics based on server instructions
  - messaging: (InitRequest <-> GenericMessage)

- **(Opt.) Local differential privacy initialization**
  - This step is optional; a flag in the InitRequest at the previous step
    indicates to clients that it is to happen, as a secondary substep.
  - Server:
    - send hyper-parameters to set up local differential privacy, including
      dp-specific hyper-parameters and information on the planned training
  - Client:
    - adjust the training process to use sample-wise gradient clipping and
      add gaussian noise to gradients, implementing the DP-SGD algorithm
    - set up a privacy accountant to monitor the use of the privacy budget
  - messaging: (PrivacyRequest <-> GenericMessage)

- **Training round**:
  - Server:
    - select clients that are to participate
    - send data-batching and effort constraints parameters
    - send shared model trainable weights and (opt. client-specific) optimizer
      auxiliary variables
  - Client:
    - update model weights and optimizer auxiliary variables
    - perform training steps based on effort constraints
    - step: compute gradients over a batch; compute updates; apply them
    - finally, send back the local model weights' updates and optimizer
      auxiliary variables
  - messaging: (TrainRequest <-> TrainReply)
  - Server:
    - unpack and aggregate clients' model weights updates into global updates
    - unpack and process clients' optimizer auxiliary variables
    - run global updates through the server's optimizer to modify and finally
      apply them

- **Evaluation round**:
  - Server:
    - select clients that are to participate
    - send data-batching parameters and shared model trainable weights
    - (_send effort constraints, unused for now_)
  - Client:
    - update model weights
    - perform evaluation steps based on effort constraints
    - step: update evaluation metrics, including the model's loss, over a batch
    - optionally checkpoint the model, local optimizer and evaluation metrics
    - send results to the server: optionally prevent sharing detailed metrics;
      always include the scalar validation loss value
  - messaging: (EvaluateRequest <-> EvaluateReply)
  - Server:
    - aggregate local loss values into a global loss metric
    - aggregate all other evaluation metrics and log their values
    - optionally checkpoint the model, optimizer, aggregated evaluation
      metrics and client-wise ones

### Hands-on usage

Here are details on how to set up server-side and client-side programs
that will run together to perform a federated learning process. Generic
remarks from the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section hold here as well, the
former section being an overly simple exemplification of the present one.

You can follow along on a concrete example that uses the UCI heart disease
dataset, that is stored in the `examples/uci-heart` folder. You may refer
to the `server.py` and `client.py` example scripts, that comprise comments
indicating how the code relates to the steps described below. For further
details on this example and on how to run it, please refer to its own
`readme.md` file.

#### Server setup instructions

1. Define a Model:

   - Set up a machine learning model in a given framework
       (_e.g._ a `torch.nn.Module`).
   - Select the appropriate `declearn.model.api.Model` subclass to wrap it up.
   - Either instantiate the `Model` or provide a JSON-serialized configuration.

2. Define a FLOptimConfig:
   - Select a `declearn.aggregator.Aggregator` (subclass) instance to define
     how clients' updates are to be aggregated into global-model updates on
     the server side.
   - Parameterize a `declearn.optimizer.Optimizer` (possibly using a selected
     pipeline of `declearn.optimizer.modules.OptiModule` plug-ins and/or a
     pipeline of `declearn.optimizer.regularizers.Regularizer` ones) to be
     used by clients to derive local step-wise updates from model gradients.
   - Similarly, parameterize an `Optimizer` to be used by the server to
     (optionally) refine the aggregated model updates before applying them.
   - Wrap these three objects into a `declearn.main.config.FLOptimConfig`,
     possibly using its `from_config` method to specify the former three
     components via configuration dicts rather than actual instances.
   - Alternatively, write up a TOML configuration file that specifies these
     components (note that 'aggregator' and 'server_opt' have default values
     and may therefore be left unspecified).

3. Define a communication server endpoint:

   - Select a communication protocol (_e.g._ "grpc" or "websockets").
   - Select the host address and port to use.
   - Preferably provide paths to PEM files storing SSL-required information.
   - Wrap this into a config dict or use `declearn.communication.build_server`
       to instantiate a `declearn.communication.api.NetworkServer` to be used.

4. Instantiate and run a FederatedServer:

   - Instantiate a `declearn.main.FederatedServer`:
     - Provide the Model, FLOptimConfig and Server objects or configurations.
     - Optionally provide a MetricSet object or its specs (i.e. a list of
       Metric instances, identifier names of (name, config) tuples), that
       defines metrics to be computed by clients on their validation data.
     - Optionally provide the path to a folder where to write output files
       (model checkpoints and global loss history).
   - Instantiate a `declearn.main.config.FLRunConfig` to specify the process:
     - Maximum number of training and evaluation rounds to run.
     - Registration parameters: exact or min/max number of clients to have
       and optional timeout delay spent waiting for said clients to join.
     - Training parameters: data-batching parameters and effort constraints
       (number of local epochs and/or steps to take, and optional timeout).
     - Evaluation parameters: data-batching parameters and effort constraints
       (optional maximum number of steps (<=1 epoch) and optional timeout).
     - Early-stopping parameters (optionally): patience, tolerance, etc. as
       to the global model loss's evolution throughout rounds.
     - Local Differential-Privacy parameters (optionally): (epsilon, delta)
       budget, type of accountant, clipping norm threshold, RNG parameters.
   - Alternatively, write up a TOML configuration file that specifies all of
     the former hyper-parameters.
   - Call the server's `run` method, passing it the former config object,
     the path to the TOML configuration file, or dictionaries of keyword
     arguments to be parsed into a `FLRunConfig` instance.


#### Clients setup instructions

1. Interface training data:

   - Select and parameterize a `declearn.dataset.Dataset` subclass that
       will interface the local training dataset.
   - Ensure its `get_data_specs` method exposes the metadata that is to
       be shared with the server (and nothing else, to prevent data leak).

2. Interface validation data (optional):

   - Optionally set up a second Dataset interfacing a validation dataset,
       used in evaluation rounds. Otherwise, those rounds will be run using
       the training dataset - which can be slow and/or lead to overfitting.

3. Define a communication client endpoint:

   - Select the communication protocol used (_e.g._ "grpc" or "websockets").
   - Provide the server URI to connect to.
   - Preferable provide the path to a PEM file storing SSL-required information
       (matching those used on the Server side).
   - Wrap this into a config dict or use `declearn.communication.build_client`
       to instantiate a `declearn.communication.api.NetworkClient` to be used.

4. Run any necessary import statement:

   - If optional or third-party dependencies are known to be required, import
       them (_e.g._ `import declearn.model.torch`).

5. Instantiate a FederatedClient and run it:

   - Instantiate a `declearn.main.FederatedClient`:
     - Provide the NetworkClient and Dataset objects or configurations.
     - Optionally specify `share_metrics=False` to prevent sharing evaluation
       metrics (apart from the aggregated loss) with the server out of privacy
       concerns.
     - Optionally provide the path to a folder where to write output files
       (model checkpoints and local loss history).
   - Call the client's `run` method and let the magic happen.

#### Logging

Note that this section and the quickstart example both left apart the option
to configure logging associated with the federated client and server, and/or
the network communication handlers they make use of. One may simply set up
custom `logging.Logger` instances and pass them as arguments to the class
constructors to replace the default, console-only, loggers.

The `declearn.utils.get_logger` function may be used to facilitate the setup
of such logger instances, defining their name, verbosity level, and whether
messages should be logged to the console and/or to an output file.

### Local Differential Privacy

#### Basics

`declearn` comes with the possibility to train models using local differential
privacy, as described in the centralized case by Abadi et al, 2016,
[Deep Learning with Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133).
This means that training can provide per-client privacy guarantees with regard
to the central server.

In practice, this can be done by simply adding a privacy field to the config
file, object or input dict to the `run` method of `FederatedServer`. Taking
the Heart UCI example, one simply has one line to add to the server-side
script (`examples/heart-uci/server.py`) in order to implement local DP,
here using Renyi-DP with epsilon=5, delta=0.00001 and a sample-wise gradient
clipping parameter that binds their euclidean norm below 3:

```python
# These are the last statements in the `run_server` function.
run_cfg = FLRunConfig.from_params(
    # The following lines come from the base example:
    rounds=20,
    register={"min_clients": nb_clients},
    training={"batch_size": 30, "drop_remainder": False},
    evaluate={"batch_size": 50, "drop_remainder": False},
    early_stop={"tolerance": 0.0, "patience": 5, "relative": False},
    # DP-specific instructions (in their absence, do not use local DP):
    privacy={"accountant": "rdp", "budget": (5, 10e-5), "sclip_norm": 3},
)
server.run(run_cfg)  # this is unaltered
```

This implementation can breach privacy garantees for some standard model
architecture and training processes, see the _Warnings and limits_ section.

#### More details on the backend

Implementing local DP requires to change four key elements, which are
automatically handled in declearn based on the provided privacy configuration:

- **Add a privacy accountant**. We use the `Opacus` library, to set up a
privacy accountant. The accountant is used in two key ways :
  - To calculate how much noise to add to the gradient at each trainig step
  to provide an $`(\epsilon-\delta)`$-DP guarantee over the total number of
  steps planned. This is where the heavily lifting is done, as estimating
  the tighest bounds on the privacy loss is a non-trivial problem. We default
  to the Renyi-DP accountant used in the original paper, but Opacus provides
  an evolving list of options, since this is an active area of research. For
  more details see the documentation of `declearn.main.utils.PrivacyConfig`.
  - To keep track of the privacy budget spent as training progresses, in
  particular in case of early stopping.

- **Implement per-sample gradient clipping**. Clipping bounds the sensitivity
of samples' contributions to model updates. It is performed using the
`max_norm` parameter of `Model.compute_batch_gradients`.

- **Implement noise-addition to applied gradients**. A gaussian noise with a
tailored variance is drawn and added to the batch-averaged gradients based on
which the local model is updated at each and every training step.

- **Use Poisson sampling to draw batches**. This is done at the `Dataset` level
using the `poisson` argument of `Dataset.generate_batches`.
  - As stated in the Opacus documentation, "Minibatches should be formed by
  uniform sampling, i.e. on each training step, each sample from the dataset
  is included with a certain probability p. Note that this is different from
  standard approach of dataset being shuffled and split into batches: each
  sample has a non-zero probability of appearing multiple times in a given
  epoch, or not appearing at all."

#### Warnings and limits

Under certain model and training specifications, two silent breaches of formal
privacy guarantees can occur. Some can be handled automatically if working
with `torch`, but need to be manually checked for in other frameworks.

- **Neural net layers that breach DP**. Standard architectures can lead
to information leaking between batch samples. Know examples include batch
normalization layers, LSTM, and multi-headed attention modules. In `torch`,
checking a module for DP-compliance can be done using Opacus, by running:

  ```python
  #given an NN.module to be tested
  from opacus import PrivacyEngine
  dp_compatible_module = PrivacyEngine.get_compatible_module(module)
  ```

- **Gradient accumulation**. This feature is not used in standard declearn
models and training tools, but users that might try to write custom hacks
to simulate large batches by setting a smaller batch size and executing the
optimization step every N steps over the accumulated sum of output gradients
should be aware that this is not compatible with Poisson sampling.

Finally, note that at this stage the DP implementation in declearn is taken
directly from the centralized training case, and as such does not account for
nor make use of some specifities of the Federated Learning process, such as
privacy amplification by iteration.

## Developers

### Contributions

Contributions to `declearn` are welcome, whether to provide fixes, suggest
new features (_e.g._ new subclasses of the core abstractions) or even push
forward framework evolutions and API revisions.

To contribute directly to the code (beyond posting issues on gitlab), please
create a dedicated branch, and submit a **Merge Request** once you want your
work reviewed and further processed to end up integrated into the package.

The **git branching strategy** is the following:

- The 'develop' branch is the main one and should receive all finalized changes
  to the source code. Release branches are then created and updated by cherry-
  picking from that branch. It therefore acts as a nightly stable version.
- The 'rX.Y' branches are release branches for each and every X.Y versions.
  For past versions, these branches enable pushing patches towards a subminor
  version release (hence being version `X.Y.(Z+1)-dev`). For future versions,
  these branches enable cherry-picking commits from main to build up an alpha,
  beta, release-candidate and eventually stable `X.Y.0` version to release.
- Feature branches should be created at will to develop features, enhancements,
  or even hotfixes that will later be merged into 'main' and eventually into
  one or multiple release branches.
- It is legit to write up poc branches, as well as to split the development of
  a feature into multiple branches that will incrementally be merged into an
  intermediate feature branch that will eventually be merged into 'main'.

The **coding rules** are fairly simple:

- Abide by [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), in a way that is
  coherent with the practices already at work in declearn.
- Abide by [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/), _i.e._ write
  docstrings **everywhere** (unless inheriting from a method, the behaviour
  and signature of which are unmodified), again using formatting that is
  coherent with the declearn practices.
- Type-hint the code, abiding by [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/);
  note that the use of Any and of "type: ignore" comments is authorized, but
  should be remain sparse.
- Lint your code with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) (for static type checking)
  and [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/) (for more general linting);
  do use "type: ..." and "pylint: disable=..." comments where you think it
  relevant, preferably with some side explanations.
  (see dedicated sub-sections below: [pylint](#running-pylint-to-check-the-code)
  and [mypy](#running-mypy-to-type-check-the-code))
- Reformat your code using [black](https://github.com/psf/black); do use
  (sparingly) "fmt: off/on" comments when you think it relevant
  (see dedicated sub-section [below](#running-black-to-format-the-code)).
- Abide by [semver](https://semver.org/) when implementing new features or
  changing the existing APIs; try making changes non-breaking, document and
  warn about deprecations or behavior changes, or make a point for API-breaking
  changes, which we are happy to consider but might take time to be released.

### Unit tests and code analysis

Unit tests, as well as more-involved functional ones, are implemented under
the `test/` folder of the present repository.
They are implemented using the [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org) framework,
as well as some third-party plug-ins (refer to [Setup][#setup] for details).

Additionally, code analysis tools are configured through the `pyproject.toml`
file, and used to control code quality upon merging to the main branch. These
tools are [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting,
[pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/) for overall static code analysis and
[mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for static type-cheking.

#### Running the test suite using tox

The third-party [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) tools may be used to run
the entire test suite within a dedicated virtual environment. Simply run `tox`
from the commandline with the root repo folder as working directory. You may
optionally specify the python version(s) with which you want to run tests.

```bash
tox           # run with default python 3.8
tox -e py310  # override to use python 3.10
```

Note that additional parameters for `pytest` may be passed as well, by adding
`--` followed by any set of options you want at the end of the `tox` command.
For example, to use the declearn-specific `--fulltest` option (see the section
below), run:

```bash
tox [tox options] -- --fulltest
```

#### Running unit tests using pytest

To run all the tests, simply use:

```bash
pytest test
```

To run the tests under a given module (here, "model"):

```bash
pytest test/model
```

To run the tests under a given file (here, "test_main.py"):

```bash
pytest test/test_main.py
```

Note that by default, some test scenarios that are considered somewhat
superfluous~redundant will be skipped in order to save time. To avoid
skipping these, and therefore run a more complete test suite, add the
`--fulltest` option to pytest:

```bash
pytest --fulltest test  # or any more-specific target you want
```

#### Running black to format the code

The [black](https://github.com/psf/black) code formatter is used to enforce
uniformity of the source code's formatting style. It is configured to have
a maximum line length of 79 (as per [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/))
and ignore auto-generated protobuf files, but will otherwise modify files
in-place when executing the following commands from the repository's root
folder:

```bash
black declearn  # reformat the package
black test      # reformat the tests
```

Note that it may also be called on individual files or folders.
One may "blindly" run black, however it is actually advised to have a look
at the reformatting operated, and act on any readability loss due to it. A
couple of advice:

1. Use `#fmt: off` / `#fmt: on` comments sparingly, but use them.
<br/>It is totally okay to protect some (limited) code blocks from
reformatting if you already spent some time and effort in achieving a
readable code that black would disrupt. Please consider refactoring as
an alternative (e.g. limiting the nest-depth of a statement).

2. Pre-format functions and methods' signature to ensure style homogeneity.
<br/>When a signature is short enough, black may attempt to flatten it as a
one-liner, whereas the norm in declearn is to have one line per argument,
all of which end with a trailing comma (for diff minimization purposes). It
may sometimes be necessary to manually write the code in the latter style
for black not to reformat it.

Finally, note that the test suite run with tox comprises code-checking by
black, and will fail if some code is deemed to require alteration by that
tool. You may run this check manually:

```bash
black --check declearn  # or any specific file or folder
```

#### Running pylint to check the code

The [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/) linter is expected to be used for
static code analysis. As a consequence, `# pylint: disable=[some-warning]`
comments can be found (and added) to the source code, preferably with some
indication as to the rationale for silencing the warning (or error).

A minimal amount of non-standard hyper-parameters are configured via the
`pyproject.toml` file and will automatically be used by pylint when run
from within the repository's folder.

Most code editors enable integrating the linter to analyze the code as it is
being edited. To lint the entire package (or some specific files or folders)
one may simply run `pylint`:

```bash
pylint declearn  # analyze the package
pylint test      # analyze the tests
```

Note that the test suite run with tox comprises the previous two commands,
which both result in a score associated with the analyzed code. If the score
does not equal 10/10, the test suite will fail - notably preventing acceptance
of merge requests.

#### Running mypy to type-check the code

The [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) linter is expected to be used for
static type-checking code analysis. As a consequence, `# type: ignore` comments
can be found (and added) to the source code, as sparingly as possible (mostly,
to silence warnings about untyped third-party dependencies, false-positives,
or locally on closure functions that are obvious enough to read from context).

Code should be type-hinted as much and as precisely as possible - so that mypy
actually provides help in identifying (potential) errors and mistakes, with
code clarity as final purpose, rather than being another linter to silence off.

A minimal amount of parameters are configured via the `pyproject.toml` file,
and some of the strictest rules are disabled as per their default value (e.g.
Any expressions are authorized - but should be used sparingly).

Most code editors enable integrating the linter to analyze the code as it is
being edited. To lint the entire package (or some specific files or folders)
one may simply run `mypy`:

```bash
mypy declearn
```

Note that the test suite run with tox comprises the previous command. If mypy
identifies errors, the test suite will fail - notably preventing acceptance
of merge requests.
