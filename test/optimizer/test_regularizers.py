"""Unit tests for Regularizer subclasses.

This script implements unit tests that are automatically run
for each and every Regularizer subclass type-registered under
the "Regularizer" group name.

These tests verify that API-defined methods can be run and
have the expected behaviour from the API's point of view -
in other words, algorithmic correctness is *not* tested as
it requires plugin-specific testing code.

However, these tests assert that the plugins' `run` method
effectively support gradients from a variety of frameworks
(NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and that the outputs have the
same values (up to reasonable numerical precision) for all
of these.
