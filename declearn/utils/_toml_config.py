    Note
    ----
    This function was mainly implemented to make up for the lack of a
    backport of `isinstance(x, Optional[T])` for Python <3.9. Thus it
    is currently private and used in a single place, with its future
    (being kept / improved / made public / removed) being unclear.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs: <T>
        Input instance that needs type-checking.
    typevar: type or typing generic
        Type hint based on which to type-check `inputs`.
        May be a base type, or a typing generic among a (limited)
        number of supported cases: Dict, List, Tuple, Union.
        Note that Optional is supported as it is a Union alias.

    Returns
    -------
    is_instance: bool
        Whether `inputs` abides by the type specified by `typevar`.
        For composed type generics, recursive type-checks may be
        conducted (e.g. to type-check elements of an iterable).

    ------

    This class aims at wrapping multiple, possibly optional, sets of

    class, dataclass, or base python type. The use of some type-hint
    annotations is supported: List, Tuple, Optional and Union may be
    used as long as they are annotated with concrete types.

    It also enables parsing these configuration from a TOML file, as
    well as instantiating from Python objects, possibly using field-
    wise parsers to convert inputs into the desired type.

    Instantiation classmethods
    --------------------------

        Instantiate by parsing a TOML configuration file.
    from_params:
        Instantiate by parsing inputs dicts (or objects).

        - If unprovided, set the argument to None.

        - Else, use the `default_parser` method.

        Notes
        -----
        - If a field supports being None, not passing a kwarg for it will
          by default result in setting it to None.
        - If a field has a default value and does not support being None,
          not passing a kwarg for it will by default result in using its
          default value.
        - If a field both has a default value and supports being None, it
          may be preferrable to pass an empty dict kwarg so as to use the
          field's default value rather than a non-default None value.
        - The former remarks hold up when the field does not benefit from
          a specific parser (that may implement arbitrary processing).
