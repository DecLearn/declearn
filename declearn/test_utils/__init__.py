"""Collection of utils for running tests and examples around declearn.

This submodule is not imported with declearn by default - it requires
being explicitly imported, and should not be so by end-users, unless
they accept the risk of using unstable features.

This submodule is *not* considered part of the stable declearn API,
meaning that its contents may change without warnings. Its features
are not designed to be used outside of the scope of declearn-shipped
tests and examples. It may also serve to introduce experimental new
features that may be ported to the stable API in the future.
