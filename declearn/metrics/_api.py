    Usage
    -----
    Single-party usage:

    >>> metric = MetricSubclass()
    >>> metric.update(y_true, y_pred)  # take one update state
    >>> metric.get_result()    # after one or multiple updates
    >>> metric.reset()  # reset before a next evaluation round
    ```

    ```
    >>> # Instantiate 2+ metrics and run local update steps.
    >>> metric_0 = MetricSubclass()
    >>> metric_1 = MetricSubclass()
    >>> metric_0.udpate(y_true_0, y_pred_0)
    >>> metric_1.update(y_true_1, y_pred_1)
    >>> # Gather and share metric states (aggregated information).
    >>> states_0 = metric_0.get_states()  # metric_0 is unaltered
    >>> states_1 = metric_1.get_states()  # metric_1 is unaltered
    >>> # Compute results that aggregate info from both clients.
    >>> states = states_0 + states_1
    >>> metric_0.set_states(states)  # would work the same with metrics_1
    >>> metric_0.get_result()
    ```

    Abstract
    --------
    To define a concrete Metric, one must subclass it and define:

    - name: str class attribute
        Name identifier of the class (should be unique across existing
        Metric classes). Also used for automatic types-registration of
        the class (see `Inheritance` section below).
    - build_initial_states() -> MetricState:
        Return the initial states for this Metric instance.
        This method is called to initialize the `_states` attribute,
        that should be used and updated by other abstract methods.
    - update(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray, s_wght: np.ndarray|None):
        Update the metric's internal state based on a data batch.
        This method should update `self._states` in-place.
    - get_result() -> dict[str, (float | np.ndarray)]:
        Compute the metric(s), based on the current state variables.
        This method should make use of `self._states` and prevent
        side effects on its contents.

    Overridable
    -----------
    Some methods may be overridden based on the concrete Metric's needs:

    - reset():
        Reset the metric to its initial state.
    - get_states() -> MetricState:
        Return a copy of the current state variables.
    - set_states(MetricState):
        Replace current state variables with a copy of inputs.

    Finally, depending on the hyper-parameters defined by the subclass's
    `__init__`, one should adjust JSON-configuration-interfacing methods:

    - get_config() -> dict[str, any]:
        Return a JSON-serializable configuration dict for this Metric.
    - from_config(config: dict[str, any]) -> Self:
        Instantiate a Metric from its configuration dict.

    Inheritance
    -----------
    When a subclass inheriting from `Metric` is declared, it is automatically
    registered under the "Metric" group using its class-attribute `name`.
    This can be prevented by adding `register=False` to the inheritance specs
    (e.g. `class MyCls(Metric, register=False)`).

    See `declearn.utils.register_type` for details on types registration.
