    """Abstract class defining an API to compute federative metrics.

    This class defines an API to instantiate stateful containers
    for one or multiple metrics, that enable computing the final
    results through iterative update steps that may additionally
    be run in a federative way.

    Usage
    -----
    Single-party usage:
    ```
    >>> metric = MetricSubclass()
    >>> metric.update(y_true, y_pred)  # take one update state
    >>> metric.get_result()    # after one or multiple updates
    >>> metric.reset()  # reset before a next evaluation round
    ```

    Multiple-parties usage:
    ```
    >>> # Instantiate 2+ metrics and run local update steps.
    >>> metric_0 = MetricSubclass()
    >>> metric_1 = MetricSubclass()
    >>> metric_0.udpate(y_true_0, y_pred_0)
    >>> metric_1.update(y_true_1, y_pred_1)
    >>> # Gather and share metric states (aggregated information).
    >>> states_0 = metric_0.get_states()  # metrics_0 is unaltered
    >>> metric_1.agg_states(states_0)     # metrics_1 is updated
    >>> # Compute results that aggregate info from both clients.
    >>> metric_1.get_result()
    ```

    Abstract
    --------
    To define a concrete Metric, one must subclass it and define:

    - name: str class attribute
        Name identifier of the class (should be unique across existing
        Metric classes). Also used for automatic types-registration of
        the class (see `Inheritance` section below).
    - _build_states() -> dict[str, (float | np.ndarray)]:
        Build and return an ensemble of state variables.
        This method is called to initialize the `_states` attribute,
        that should be used and updated by other abstract methods.
    - update(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray, s_wght: np.ndarray|None):
        Update the metric's internal state based on a data batch.
        This method should update `self._states` in-place.
    - get_result() -> dict[str, (float | np.ndarray)]:
        Compute the metric(s), based on the current state variables.
        This method should make use of `self._states` and prevent
        side effects on its contents.

    Overridable
    -----------
    Some methods may be overridden based on the concrete Metric's needs.
    The most imporant one is the states-aggregation method:

    - agg_states(states: dict[str, (float | np.ndarray)]:
        Aggregate provided state variables into self ones.
        By default, it expects input and internal states to have
        similar specifications, and aggregates them by summation,
        which might no be proper depending on the actual metric.

    A pair of methods may be extended to cover non-`self._states`-contained
    variables:

    - reset():
        Reset the metric to its initial state.
    - get_states() -> dict[str, (float | np.ndarray)]:
        Return a copy of the current state variables.


    Finally, depending on the hyper-parameters defined by the subclass's
    `__init__`, one should adjust JSON-configuration-interfacing methods:

    - get_config() -> dict[str, any]:
        Return a JSON-serializable configuration dict for this Metric.
    - from_config(config: dict[str, any]) -> Self:
        Instantiate a Metric from its configuration dict.

    Inheritance
    -----------
    When a subclass inheriting from `Metric` is declared, it is automatically
    registered under the "Metric" group using its class-attribute `name`.
    This can be prevented by adding `register=False` to the inheritance specs
    (e.g. `class MyCls(Metric, register=False)`).

    See `declearn.utils.register_type` for details on types registration.
