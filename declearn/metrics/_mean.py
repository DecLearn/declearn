    """Generic mean-aggregation metric template.

    This abstract class implements a template for Metric classes
    that rely on computing a sample-wise score and its average
    across iterative inputs.

    Abstract
    --------
    To implement such an actual Metric, inherit `MeanMetric` and define:

    - name: str class attribute:
        Name identifier of the Metric (should be unique across existing
        Metric classes). Used for automated type-registration and name-
        based retrieval. Also used to label output results.
    - metric_func(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        Method that computes a score from the predictions and labels
        associated with a given batch, that is to be aggregated into
        an average metric across all input batches.

        This method is called by the `update` one, which adds optional
        sample-weighting and updates the metric's states to eventually
        compute the average metric over a sequence of input batches.

        Parameters
        ----------
        y_true: numpy.ndarray
            True labels or values that were to be predicted.
        y_pred: numpy.ndarray
            Predictions (scores or values) that are to be evaluated.
