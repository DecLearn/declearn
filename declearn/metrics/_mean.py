    Abstract
    --------
    To implement such an actual Metric, inherit `MeanMetric` and define:

    - name: str class attribute:
        Name identifier of the Metric (should be unique across existing
        Metric classes). Used for automated type-registration and name-
        based retrieval. Also used to label output results.
    - metric_func(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        Method that computes a score from the predictions and labels
        associated with a given batch, that is to be aggregated into
        an average metric across all input batches.
