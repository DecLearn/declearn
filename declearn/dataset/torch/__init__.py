"""Dataset interface to wrap up 'torch.utils.data.Dataset' instances.

The main class implementing by this submodule is `TorchDataset`:

* [TorchDataset][declarn.dataset.torch.TorchDataset]:
    Dataset subclass serving torch Datasets.

Some utils are also exposed here, either used as part of the `TorchDataset`
backend or to be used in conjunction with it:

* [PoissonSampler][declearn.dataset.torch.PoissonSampler]:
    Custom `torch.utils.data.Sampler` implementing Poisson sampling.
* [collate_with_padding][declearn.dataset.torch.collate_with_padding]:
    Custom collate function that implements variable-lenght inputs' padding.
