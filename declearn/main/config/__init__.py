"""Tools to specify hyper-parameters of a Federated Learning process.

This submodule exposes dataclasses that group, document and facilitate
parsing (from instances, config dicts and/or TOML files) elements that
are required to specify a Federated Learning process from the server's
side.

The main classes implemented here are:

* [FLRunConfig][declearn.main.config.FLRunConfig]:
    Federated learning orchestration hyper-parameters.
* [FLOptimConfig][declearn.main.config.FLOptimConfig]:
    Federated optimization strategy.

The following dataclasses are articulated by `FLRunConfig`:

* [EvaluateConfig][declearn.main.config.EvaluateConfig]:
    Hyper-parameters for an evaluation round.
* [RegisterConfig][declearn.main.config.RegisterConfig]:
    Hyper-parameters for clients registration.
* [TrainingConfig][declearn.main.config.TrainingConfig]:
    Hyper-parameters for a training round.
