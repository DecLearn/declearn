"""Main classes implementing a Federated Learning process.

This module mainly implements the following two classes:

* [FederatedClient][declearn.main.FederatedClient]:
    Client-side main Federated Learning orchestrating class
* [FederatedServer][declearn.main.FederatedServer]:
    Server-side main Federated Learning orchestrating class

This module also implements the following submodules, used by the former:

* [config][declearn.main.config]:
    Server-side dataclasses that specify a FL process's parameter.
    The main classes implemented here are `FLRunConfig` and `FLOptimConfig`,
    that implement parameters' parsing from python objets or from TOML files.
* [privacy][declearn.main.privacy]:
    Differentially-Private training routine utils.
    The main class implemented here is `DPTrainingManager` that implements
    client-side DP-SGD training. This module is to be manually imported or
    lazy-imported by `FederatedClient`, and may trigger warnings or errors
    in the absence of the 'opacus' third-party dependency.
* [utils][declearn.main.utils]:
    Various utils to the FL process.
    The main class of interest for end-users is `TrainingManager`, that
    implements client-side training and evaluation routines, and may
    therefore be leveraged in a non-FL setting or to implement other
    FL process routines than the centralized one defined here.
