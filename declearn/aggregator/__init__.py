"""Model updates aggregating API and implementations.

An `Aggregator` is typically meant to be used on a round-wise basis by
the orchestrating server of a centralized federated learning process,
to aggregate the client-wise model updated into a `Vector` that may then
be used as "gradients" by the server's `Optimizer` to update the global
model.

This declearn submodule provides with:

API tools
---------

* [Aggregator][declearn.aggregator.Aggregator]:
    Abstract base class defining an API for Vector aggregation.
* [list_aggregators][declearn.aggregator.list_aggregators]:
    Return a mapping of registered Aggregator subclasses.


Concrete classes
----------------

* [AveragingAggregator][declearn.aggregator.AveragingAggregator]:
    Average-based-aggregation Aggregator subclass.
* [GradientMaskedAveraging][declearn.aggregator.GradientMaskedAveraging]:
    Gradient Masked Averaging Aggregator subclass.
