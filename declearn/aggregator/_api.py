    """Abstract class defining an API for Vector aggregation.

    The aim of this abstraction (which itself operates on the Vector
    abstraction, so as to provide framework-agnostic algorithms) is
    to enable implementing arbitrary aggregation rules to turn local
    model updates into global updates in a federated learning context.

    An Aggregator is typically meant to be used on a round-wise basis
    by the orchestrating server of a centralized federated learning
    process, to aggregate the client-wise model updated into a Vector
    that may then be used as "gradients" by the server's Optimizer to
    update the global model.

    Abstract
    --------
    The following attribute and method require to be overridden
    by any non-abstract child class of `Aggregator`:

    - name: str class attribute
        Name identifier of the class (should be unique across existing
        Aggregator classes). Also used for automatic types-registration
        of the class (see `Inheritance` section below).
    - aggregate(updates: Dict[str, Vector], n_steps: Dict[str, int]) -> Vector:
        Aggregate input vectors into a single one.
        This is the main method for any `Aggregator`.

    Overridable
    -----------
    - get_config() -> Dict[str, Any]:
        Return a JSON-serializable configuration dict of an instance.
    - from_config(Dict[str, Any]) -> Aggregator:
        Classmethod to instantiate an Aggregator from a config dict.

    Inheritance
    -----------
    When a subclass inheriting from `Aggregator` is declared, it is
    automatically registered under the "Aggregator" group using its
    class-attribute `name`. This can be prevented by adding `register=False`
    to the inheritance specs (e.g. `class MyCls(Aggregator, register=False)`).
    See `declearn.utils.register_type` for details on types registration.
