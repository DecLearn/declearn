    instance resulting from the aggregation of multiple peers' data may

    into a `Vector` of model updates.

    This class also defines whether contents are compatible with secure
    aggregation, and whether some fields should remain in cleartext no
    matter what.

    Note that subclasses are automatically type-registered, and should be
    decorated as `dataclasses.dataclass`. To prevent registration, simply

    """Abstract class defining an API for model updates aggregation.

    The aim of this abstraction (which itself operates on the Vector
    abstraction, so as to provide framework-agnostic algorithms) is
    to enable implementing arbitrary aggregation rules to turn local
    model updates into global updates in a federated or decentralized
    learning context.

    An Aggregator has three main purposes:

    - Preparing and packaging data that is to be shared with peers
      based on local model updates into a `ModelUpdates` container
      that implements aggregation, usually via summation.
    - Finalizing such a data container into model updates.

    Abstract
    --------
    The following class attributes and methods must be implemented
    by any non-abstract child class of `Aggregator`:

    - name: str class attribute
        Name identifier of the class (should be unique across Aggregator
        classes). Also used for automatic type-registration of the class
        (see `Inheritance` section below).
    - prepare_for_sharing(updates: Vector, n_steps: int) -> ModelUpdates:
        Pre-process and package local model updates for aggregation.
    - finalize_updates(updates: ModelUpdates):
        Finalize pre-aggregated data into global model updates.

    Overridable
    -----------
    - updates_cls: type[ModelUpdates] class attribute
        Type of 'ModelUpdates' data structure used by this Aggregator class.
    - get_config() -> Dict[str, Any]:
        Return a JSON-serializable configuration dict of an instance.
    - from_config(Dict[str, Any]) -> Aggregator:
        Classmethod to instantiate an Aggregator from a config dict.

    Inheritance
    -----------
    When a subclass inheriting from `Aggregator` is declared, it is
    automatically registered under the "Aggregator" group using its
    class-attribute `name`. This can be prevented by adding `register=False`
    to the inheritance specs (e.g. `class MyCls(Aggregator, register=False)`).
    See `declearn.utils.register_type` for details on types registration.
