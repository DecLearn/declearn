"""Submodule implementing client/server communications.

This is done by  defining server-side and client-side network communication
endpoints for federated learning processes, as well as suitable messages to
be transmitted, and the available communication protocols.

This module contains the following core submodules:

* [api][declearn.communication.api]:
    Base API to define client- and server-side communication endpoints.
* [messaging][declearn.communication.messaging]:
    Message dataclasses defining information containers to be exchanged
    between communication endpoints.

It also exposes the following core utility functions and dataclasses:

* [build_client][declearn.communication.build_client]:
    Instantiate a NetworkClient, selecting its subclass based on protocol name.
* [build_server][declearn.communication.build_server]:
    Instantiate a NetworkServer, selecting its subclass based on protocol name.
* [list_available_protocols][declearn.communication.list_available_protocols]:
    List the protocol names for which both a NetworkClient and NetworkServer
    classes are registered (hence available to `build_client`/`build_server`).
* [NetworkClientConfig][declearn.communication.NetworkClientConfig]:
    TOML-parsable dataclass for network clients' instantiation.
* [NetworkServerConfig][declearn.communication.NetworkServerConfig]:
    TOML-parsable dataclass for network servers' instantiation.


Finally, it defines the following protocol-specific submodules, provided
the associated third-party dependencies are available:

* [grpc][declearn.communication.grpc]:
    gRPC-based network communication endpoints.
    Requires the `grpcio` and `protobuf` third-party packages.
* [websockets][declearn.communication.websockets]:
    WebSockets-based network communication endpoints.
    Requires the `websockets` third-party package.
