    """Abstract class defining an API for server-side communication endpoints.

    This class defines the key methods used to communicate between
    a server and its clients during a federated learning process,
    agnostic to the actual communication protocol in use.

    Instantiating a `NetworkServer` does not instantly serve the declearn
    messaging program on the selected host and port. To enable clients
    to connect to the server via a `NetworkServer` object, its `start`
    method must first be awaited, and conversely, its `stop` method
    should be awaited to close the connection:
    ```
    >>> server = ServerSubclass(
    ...     "example.domain.com", 8765, "cert_path", "pkey_path"
    ... )
    >>> await server.start()
    >>> try:
    >>>     data_info = server.wait_for_clients(...)
    >>>     ...
    >>> finally:
    >>>     await server.stop()
    ```

    An alternative syntax to achieve the former is using the server
    object as an asynchronous context manager:
    ```
    >>> async with ServerSubclass(...) as server:
    >>>     data_info = server.wait_for_clients(...)
    >>>     ...
    ```

    Note that a `NetworkServer` manages an allow-list of clients,
    which is defined based on `NetworkClient.register(...)`-emitted
    requests during a registration phase restricted to the context
    of the awaitable `wait_for_clients` method.
