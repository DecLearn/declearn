    """Abstract class defining an API for client-side communication endpoints.

    This class defines the key methods used to communicate between a
    client and the orchestrating server during a federated learning
    process, agnostic to the actual communication protocol in use.

    Instantiating a `NetworkClient` does not trigger a connection to
    the target server. To enable communicating with the server via a
    `NetworkClient` object, its `start` method must first be awaited
    and conversely, its `stop` method should be awaited to close the
    connection:
    ```
    >>> client = ClientSubclass("example.domain.com:8765", "name", "cert_path")
    >>> await client.start()
    >>> try:
    >>>     client.register()
    >>>     ...
    >>> finally:
    >>>     await client.stop()
    ```

    An alternative syntax to achieve the former is using the client
    object as an asynchronous context manager:
    ```
    >>> async with ClientSubclass(...) as client:
    >>>     client.register()
    >>>     ...
    ```

    Note that a declearn `NetworkServer` manages an allow-list of
    clients, which is defined during a registration phase of limited
    time, based on requests emitted through the `NetworkClient.register`
    method. Any message emitted using `NetworkClient.send_message` will
    probably be rejected by the server if the client has not registered.
