    This function aims at making it easy for end-users to list and access

    the associated plug-in to a [declearn.optimizer.Optimizer][] without
    going through the fuss of importing and instantiating it manually.

    Note that the mapping will include all declearn-provided plug-ins,
    but also registered plug-ins provided by user or third-party code.
