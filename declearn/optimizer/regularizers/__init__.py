"""Optimizer loss-regularization algorithms, implemented as plug-in modules.

API base class
--------------
* Regularizer: base API for loss-regularization plug-ins

Common regularization terms
---------------------------
* [LassoRegularizer][declearn.optimizer.regularizers.LassoRegularizer]:
    L1 regularization, aka Lasso penalization.
* [RidgeRegularizer][declearn.optimizer.regularizers.RidgeRegularizer]:
    L2 regularization, aka Ridge penalization.

Federated-Learning-specific regularizers
----------------------------------------
* [FedProxRegularizer][declearn.optimizer.regularizers.FedProxRegularizer]:
    FedProx algorithm, as a proximal term regularizer.
