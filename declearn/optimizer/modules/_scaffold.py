"""SCAFFOLD algorithm for FL, implemented as a pair of plug-in modules.

The pair of `OptiModule` classes implemented here serve to implement
the SCAFFOLD (Stochastic Averaging for Federated Learning) algorithm
as a plug-in option to optimizer processes.

They only implement Option-II of the paper regarding client-specific
state variables' update, and implementing Option-I would require the
use of a specific Optimizer sub-class.

    """Client-side Stochastic Controlled Averaging (SCAFFOLD) module.

    This module is to be added to the optimizer used by a federated-
    learning client, and expects that the server's optimizer use its
    counterpart module:
    [`ScaffoldServerModule`][declearn.optimizer.modules.ScaffoldServerModule].

    This module implements the following algorithm:

        Init:
            delta = 0
            _past = 0
            _step = 0
        Step(grads):
            _past += grads
            _step += 1
            grads = grads - delta
        Send:
            state = (_past / _step)
        Receive(delta):
            delta = delta
            reset(_past, _step) to 0

    In other words, this module receives a "delta" variable from the
    server instance which is set as the difference between a client-
    specific state and a shared one, and corrects input gradients by
    adding this delta to it. At the end of a training round (made of
    multiple steps) it computes an updated client state based on the
    accumulated sum of corrected gradients. This value is to be sent
    to the server, that will emit a new value for the local delta in
    return.

    The SCAFFOLD algorithm is described in reference [1].
    The server-side correction of aggregated gradients, the storage
    of raw local and shared states, and the computation of the updated
    shared state and derived client-wise delta values are deferred to
    `ScaffoldServerModule`.

    The formula applied to compute the updated local state variables
    corresponds to the "Option-II" in the paper.
    Implementing Option-I would require holding a copy of the shared
    model and computing its gradients in addition to those of the
    local model, effectively doubling computations. This can be done
    in `declearn`, but requires implementing an alternative training
    procedure rather than an optimizer plug-in.

        Note: the computed update is *not* applied by this method.

        The computation implemented here is equivalent to "Option II"
        of the SCAFFOLD paper. In that paper, authors write that:
            c_i^+ = (c_i - c) + (x - y_i) / (K * eta_l)
        where x are the shared model's weights, y_i are the local
        model's weights after K optimization steps with eta_l lr,
        c is the shared global state and c_i is the local state.

        Noting that (x - y_i) is in fact the difference between the
        local model's weights before and after running K training
        steps, we rewrite it as eta_l * Sum_k(grad(y_i^k) - D_i),
        where we define D_i = (c_i - c). Thus we rewrite c_i^+ as:
            c_i^+ = D_i + (1/K)*Sum_k(grad(y_i^k) - D_i)
        When then note that D_i is constant and can be taken out
        of the summation term, leaving us with:
            c_i^+ = Avg_k(grad(y_i^k))

        Hence the new local state can be computed by averaging the
        gradients input to this module along the training steps.

    to local gradients. At the end of a training round, aggregated
    gradients are corrected by substracting the shared state value
    from them. Finally, updated local states received from clients
    are recorded, and used to update the shared state variable, so
    that new delta values can be sent to clients as the next round
