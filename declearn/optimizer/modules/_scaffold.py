"""SCAFFOLD algorithm for FL, implemented as a pair of plug-in modules.

The pair of `OptiModule` classes implemented here serve to implement
the SCAFFOLD (Stochastic Averaging for Federated Learning) algorithm
as a plug-in option to optimizer processes.

They only implement Option-II of the paper regarding client-specific
state variables' update, and implementing Option-I would require the
use of a specific Optimizer sub-class.

class ScaffoldClientModule(OptiModule[ScaffoldAuxVar]):
    """Client-side Stochastic Controlled Averaging (SCAFFOLD) module.

    This module is to be added to the optimizer used by a federated-
    learning client, and expects that the server's optimizer use its
    counterpart module:
    [`ScaffoldServerModule`][declearn.optimizer.modules.ScaffoldServerModule].

    This module implements the following algorithm:

        Init:
            state = 0
            local = 0
            delta = 0
            _past = 0
            _step = 0
        Step(grads):
            _past += grads
            _step += 1
            grads = grads - delta
        Send -> l_upd:
            loc_n = (_past / _step)
            l_upd = loc_n - local
            local = loc_n
        Receive(state):
            state = state
            delta = local - state
            reset(_past, _step) to 0

    In other words, this module applies a correction term to each
    and every input gradient, which is defined as the difference
    between a local (node-specific) state and a global one, which
    is received from a paired server-side module. At the end of a
    training round (made of multiple steps) it computes an updated
    local state based on the accumulated sum of raw input gradients.
    The difference between the new and previous local states is then
    shared with the server, that aggregates client-wise updates into
    the new global state and emits it towards nodes in return.

    The SCAFFOLD algorithm is described in reference [1].
    The server-side correction of aggregated gradients, the storage
    of raw local and shared states, and the computation of the updated
    shared state and derived client-wise delta values are deferred to
    `ScaffoldServerModule`.

    The formula applied to compute the updated local state variables
    corresponds to the "Option-II" in the paper.
    Implementing Option-I would require holding a copy of the shared
    model and computing its gradients in addition to those of the
    local model, effectively doubling computations. This can be done
    in `declearn`, but requires implementing an alternative training
    procedure rather than an optimizer plug-in.

        The computation implemented here is equivalent to "Option II"

            c_i^+ = (c_i - c) + (x - y_i) / (K * eta_l)
        where x are the shared model's weights, y_i are the local
        model's weights after K optimization steps with eta_l lr,
        c is the shared global state and c_i is the local state.

        Noting that (x - y_i) is in fact the difference between the
        local model's weights before and after running K training
        steps, we rewrite it as eta_l * Sum_k(grad(y_i^k) - D_i),
        where we define D_i = (c_i - c). Thus we rewrite c_i^+ as:
            c_i^+ = D_i + (1/K)*Sum_k(grad(y_i^k) - D_i)
        Noting that D_i is constant across steps, we take it out of
        the summation term, leaving us with:
            c_i^+ = (1/K)*Sum_k(grad(y_i^k))

    updates are sum-aggregated into an update for the global state
