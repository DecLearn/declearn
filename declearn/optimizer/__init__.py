"""Framework-agnostic optimizer tools, both generic or FL-specific.

In more details, we here define an `Optimizer` class that wraps together a set
of plug-in modules, used to implement various optimization and regularization
techniques.

Main class:

* [Optimizer][declearn.optimizer.Optimizer]:
    Base class to define gradient-descent-based optimizers.

Submodules providing with plug-in algorithms:

* [modules][declearn.optimizer.modules]:
    Gradients-alteration algorithms, implemented as plug-in modules.
* [regularizers][declearn.optimizer.regularizers]:
    Loss-regularization algorithms, implemented as plug-in modules.

Utils to list available plug-ins:

* [list_optim_modules][declearn.optimizer.list_optim_modules]:
    Return a mapping of registered OptiModule subclasses.
* [list_optim_regularizers][declearn.optimizer.list_optim_regularizers]:
    Return a mapping of registered Regularizer subclasses.
