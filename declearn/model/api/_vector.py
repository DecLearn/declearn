    A Vector is an abstraction used to wrap a collection of data

    It enables writing algorithms and operations on such structures,
    agnostic of their actual implementation support.

    Use `vector.coefs` to access the stored coefficients.

    Any concrete Vector subclass should:

    - add type checks to `__init__` to control wrapped coefficients' type
    - opt. override `_op_...` properties to define compatible operators
    - implement the abstract operators (`sign`, `maximum`, `minimum`...)
    - opt. override `pack` and `unpack` to enable their serialization
    - opt. extend `compatible_vector_types` to specify their compatibility
      with other Vector subclasses
